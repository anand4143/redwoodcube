                <h4>What is Digital Marketing?</h4>
								<p>When you advertise or sell a particular product or service by using digital technologies with the help of the ‘Internet,’ that is simply called digital Marketing. Digital Marketing also includes other electronic or digital medium like cell-phones, display advertising, google, Facebook or YouTube ads etc.</p>
								
                <h4>Why Digital Marketing?</h4>
                <p>During the traditional trading time, the product and services which were available were less in numbers in comparison to today's world. Today, what you sell as a product or service, already has uncountable substitutes. And, if you don’t come up with something new or unique which is in demand and has a futuristic scope of expansion you will fall behind.</p>

						<h4>What has changed in today’s world of trading or advertising?</h4>
								<p>The answer is the evolution of the Internet, social media platforms, cheaper data packs, and an unbreakable bond between people and their engagement on digital platforms. Today everyone has cell phones, they listen, see, hear everything whether it's good or bad. And in between this, you have the opportunity to create their utility into a visible product and service, to fulfil their demands.
